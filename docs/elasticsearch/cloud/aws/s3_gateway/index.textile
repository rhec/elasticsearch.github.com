h1. S3 Gateway

p. s3 based gateway allows to do long term reliable async persistency of the index directly to Amazon s3. Here is how it can be configured:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
cloud:
    aws:
        access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ
        secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br


gateway:
    type: s3
    s3:
        bucket: bucket_name
</pre>

p. The following are a list of settings (prefixed with @gateway.s3@) that can further control the s3 gateway:

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|@chunk_size@|Big files are broken down into chunks (to overcome AWS 5g limit). Default set to @100m@.|
