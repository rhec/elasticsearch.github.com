h1. Bool Query

p. A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries. The bool query maps to Lucene @BooleanQuery@. It is built using one or more boolean clauses, each clause with a typed occurrence. The occurrence types are:

|_. Occur |_. Description |
| @must@ | The clause (query) must appear in matching documents. |
| @should@ | The clause (query) should appear in the matching document. A boolean query with no @must@ clauses, one or more @should@ clauses must match a document. The minimum number of should clauses to match can be set using @minimum_number_should_match@ parameter. |
| @must_not@ | The clause (query) must not appear in the matching documents. Note that it is not possible to search on documents that only consists of a @must_not@ clauses. |
